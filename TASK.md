Create a single page Angular application 

that takes response from an API and displays the
returned results on a screen. 

The results should be given to a re-usable component that creates
a list for all entries, and a re-usable child component is rendered for each entry in the list.

This task is intended to not take up too much of your time and take approximately 1 hour. The
completed source code should be shared via github.
Further information:
- API to be used:Â https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
- Angular should be used as the front-end framework
- Use any open-source libraries you would like
- Use your preferred design pattern and coding standards
- Automated unit testing required
- Provide a well laid out screen with good CSS practices. (Use your imagination)
- Add a read me file with commands to compile, test and run the application
