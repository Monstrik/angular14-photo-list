## Developer notes

Warning!!! Don't treat this code as a production ready or close to production code.

Production code require efficient, testable, modular, reusable, typed, clean, documented or self documented.

I just created minimal to show working and functional components + basic unit tests

Other tests and features will be added by request and payments :)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a
package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
